# Descartes

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Docker
- docker-compose
- node 14.x
- yarn
- jinja2

### Cloning

Make sure to include the submodules:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules ssh://github.com/cartesi/descartes.git
```
or using the http address:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cartesi/descartes.git
```

### Deploying
```
npx hardhat deploy â€”network $network
```

### Running

To run execute:
```
% docker build . -t cartesi/descartes:local
% yarn
% jinja2 -D num_players=2 docker-compose-template.yml | docker-compose -f - up --build
```

To shutdown:
```
% jinja2 -D num_players=2 docker-compose-template.yml | docker-compose -f - down -v
```

To run using one of the [supported networks](https://cartesi.io/en/docs/descartes/supported-networks/), you should:
- Define a `MNEMONIC` environment variable
- If using Infura, define a `PROJECT_ID` environment variable
- Specify the argument `"-D network=<name>"`, where `name` should be one of the following supported networks: `rinkeby`, `kovan`, `goerli`, `matic_testnet`, `bsc_testnet` or `avax_testnet`

For instance, for using the Goerli testnet using Infura, run:
```
% export MNEMONIC=<your_mnemonic>
% export PROJECT_ID=<your_infura_project_id>
% jinja2 -D num_players=2 -D network=goerli docker-compose-template.yml | docker-compose -f - up --build
```

You can follow the output of a docker instance with:
```
% docker logs -f [name of the instance]
```
The instance could be retrieved by the command:
```
% docker ps --format {{.Names}}
```

This will run an environment connected to a private net (ganache or geth), with descartes already deployed.

There are a number of sample computations available within the `scripts` directory. To execute one of these computations on the environment, you need to first store the corresponding machine template in the `machines` directory (as configured in the docker-compose template). As such, for the `helloworld` application, execute the following commands:
```
% cd scripts
% ./helloworld/build-cartesi-machine.sh ../machines
```

Then, instantiate the computation using `hardhat`:
```
% npx hardhat run --network localhost --no-compile helloworld/instantiate.ts
```

After that, it will possible to query the computation result running the `getResult.ts` script:
```
% npx hardhat run --network localhost --no-compile getResult.ts
```
### IPFS Example
  
Among the sample computations, there is an example of usage of drive distribution through IPFS. Inside the folder there is a file `run.sh` and that is the only script you need to execute after starting the environment.

```
% ./scripts/ipfs/run.sh
```
