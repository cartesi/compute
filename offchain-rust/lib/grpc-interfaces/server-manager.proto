package CartesiServerManager;

// The version implemented by an instance of the Cartesi Server Manager can be obtained with a call to GetVersion.
// Each Cartesi Server Manager controls a variety of independent Sessions (see StartSession).
// The current list of Sessions can be obtained with a call to GetStatus.
// Each Session controls a single Cartesi Machine through a connection to a Cartesi Machine Server that the
// Server Manager itself spawns for the session.
// The Cartesi Machine is specified in the StartSession request, by directory.
// Each Session is divided into Epochs.
// The list of past Epochs (and the current Epoch) for a Session can be obtained with a call to GetSessionStatus.
// Within each Epoch, the state of the associated machine is advanced by individual inputs (see AdvanceState).
// The processing of each input, when successful, may produce several Vouchers (i.e., collateral effects
// actionable in the blockchain) and a variety of Notices (which describe any relevant changes to the internal
// state of applications running inside the Cartesi Machine).
// The current Epoch can be closed (and the next Epoch started) with a call to FinishEpoch.
// This is a synchronous call that can only be issued after all inputs in the active epoch have been processed.
// The entire state of the machine can be stored on disk (and later recovered) when the Epoch is finished.
// A closed epoch can be deleted to free the Server Manager's memory with a call to DeleteEpoch.
// An input can be skipped for a variety of reasons (see CompletionStatus).
// Whether successfully processed or skipped, the machine can produce a variety of Reports (i.e., diagnostics, logs, etc)
// Input processing is asynchronous: the results of all processed inputs for processing can be
// obtained with a call to GetEpochStatus.
// Information about an Epoch is retained until its Session is terminated (see EndSession).
// (Note that machines stored on disk are always retained.)
// When an input is skipped, for whatever reason, the state of the Cartesi Machine is reverted to what it was
// before the input was given to the machine: i.e., from the perspective of the machine, it never happened.
// Certain error conditions may cause a Session to become unusable.
// An unusable Session is said to be "tainted".
// All further operations in a tainted Session (other than EndSession) will fail.
// The underlying reason can be obtained with a call to GetSessionStatus.
// Between inputs, the state of the machine can be inspected with a query (see InspectState).
// Processing of a query can produce a variety of Reports.
// Processing of a query can be aborted for a variety of reasons (see CompletionStatus).
// After the query is processed, the state of the Cartesi Machine is reverted to what it was before the query was given
// to the machine: i.e., from the perspective of the machine, it never happened.
// State inspection is synchronous: the query is processed as soon as the current input is done (if any) and all
// produced Reports are immediately returned.
// A Cartesi Machine used with the Cartesi Server Manager must define 5 memory ranges, in addition to however
// many flash drives the application it runs might require.
// Each memory range must have a power-of-two length and must start at a multiple of its size.
// The first two are the rx buffer and tx buffer memory ranges.
// The rx buffer is used by the Cartesi Server Manager to send the input and query payloads into the Cartesi
// Machine.
// The tx buffer is used by the Cartesi Machine to send Vouchers, Notices, and Reports to the Cartesi Server
// Manager.
// Each input to AdvanceState, in addition to the payload, requires some metadata.
// This is sent into the Cartesi Machine through the input metadata memory range.
// The last two remaining memory ranges are the voucher hashes and notice hashes memory ranges.
// These contain an array of hashes, respectively of each voucher and notice produced while processing input.
// Whenever an input is processed, the Cartesi Server Manager collects from the Cartesi Machine a Merkle proof
// that the voucher hashes and notice hashes memory ranges are part of the Cartesi Machine State.
// Likewise, each voucher and notice accompanies a proof that its hash is part of, respectively, the voucher hashes
// memory range and notice hashes memory range.
// Finally, the Cartesi Server Manager also maintains two additional Merkle trees, respectively containing as
// leaves the Merkle tree root hash of the voucher hashes memory range and the notice hashes memory range.
